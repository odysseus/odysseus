## Education
University of Colorado, Boulder - BA Economics and BA Political Science -- **December 2008**

## Programming Experience
**Ruby: 2 Years**  
I Fell in love with Ruby several years ago, after spending time with a variety of languages, Python and Java in particular, and haven't looked back.  I have an advanced knowledge of Ruby specific features, including Ruby metaprogramming techniques.  For examples, please see my Project Euler solutions on Github. 

**Rails: 1 Year**  
I've used Rails and followed its developments off and on for several years.  I think its a fantastic tool and has a terrific community behind it.  My goal is to apply what I've learned thusfar to a major rails app, and to keep expanding my knowledge of the whole Rails ecosystem.

**HTML/CSS/Haml/SASS: 1 Year**  
I've worked extensively with HTML and CSS, including HTML5 and CSS3.  I have a strong working knowledge of both and am actively learning more.  On top of that, I've built sites using HAML and SASS,  I love the efficiency they add to your workflow, especially when combined with the asset pipeline in Rails.

**Javascript / jQuery: < 1 Year**  
I came late to the JavaScript party, but in the past year I've made it a goal of mine to delve into client side scripting.  jQuery in particular is an absolute pleasure to code in, and CoffeeScript improves on that even more, giving the whole thing a very Rubyesque feel.  While I would still consider myself intermediate in terms of JavaScript I've found the programmatic concepts in jQuery very intuitive and I feel confident that with a little research and trial and error I could get through any JavaScript challenge.  

**SQL: 1 Year**  
I worked with SQL databases to analyze loan portfolios at Global Financial Review.  I would consider myself intermediate in relational databases:  I can put together queries, I understand the syntax, and I know the basics of database design, but the abstraction that Rails allows means I haven't spent as much time interacting directly with a database.  

**RSpec: 1 Year**
I've used RSpec for both TDD and BDD in Rails, along with Capybara and Shoulda.  I am comfortable with testing all areas of a Rails application.  I have exposure to Cucumber, but I have not used it extensively. 

**Other Languages and Concepts**  
Exposure to different programming languages has been something of an obsession of mine.  I started with Python before moving to Java, then continued on my tour of compiled languages with C++ and C.  Thanks to the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs I spent a while learning Lisp/Scheme and experimented with an early version of Clojure.  This is a short list, one that I include only as evidence of my insatiable curiosity and ability to learn.  I may not know every component in your stack but given the opportunity I am more than capable of learning, and I would relish the opportunity to expand my skill set.

## Additional Skills

**Statistics / Econometrics**  
Advanced statistical analysis as well as econometric regression analysis.  A deeper understanding of statistics and randomness has been one of the most useful things I've ever studied, and has been applicable in nearly every area of my personal and professional life.  In fact, it was the study of randomness in the wake of the subprime crisis that led me to pursue programming. 

**Leadership**  
Throughout my life I've held a number of leadership positions, some of which I sought out and others that were thrust upon me, managing a huge range of different people.  This diversity of leadership experiences has made me very versatile when it comes to working with other people, even when not in leadership position. 

**People Skills**  
Working on a cruise ship seven days a week, 10+ hours a day was trying in a number of ways, but nothing was more challenging or more important than maintaining a sunny demeanor at all times and under every circumstance.  It was an invaluable lesson in people skills and customer service.

**Strategy**  
Military strategy, business strategy, salesmanship, politics, game theory, etc.  If it has a strategic element then odds are I've studied it at some point.  While not specifically CS related, I've found it to be a useful skill in a wide range of jobs.
